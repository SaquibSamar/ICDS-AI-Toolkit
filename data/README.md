# Sample ICDS Data

This folder contains a **small synthetic (dummy) ICDS-like dataset** used only to demonstrate the data structure required by the ICDS AI Toolkit.

## Purpose
- Showcase the expected format of ICDS child-level data
- Enable testing and demonstration of the AI logic
- Ensure privacy and responsible AI usage

## Data Characteristics
- Fully synthetic (no real child data)
- Mirrors real ICDS indicators such as:
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Nutrition metrics (Weight, MUAC)
  - Attendance
  - Village and Anganwadi identifiers

## Important Note
This dataset is **not real ICDS data** and is provided only for demonstration purposes.  
The AI logic and Power BI dashboards are fully compatible with authorised real ICDS datasets without any code changes.
